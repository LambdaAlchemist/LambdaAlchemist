These be me workshop tools, and mine only shall be.

## Homebrew
The undeniable great of POSIX package management, compatible with both MacOS and Linux.
Though it has it's caveats, and minutia of problems here and there, it has become a tool
like few others, since Mac has not it's own package management, and Linux is all
over the place, considering it's various different interfaces (`dpkg` and `apt` are still the best).
It has become the core of my scripts, my dotfiles.

## Visual Studio Code - Vim - Neovim
I believe it is somewhat self explanatory, Vim is great, Neovim is great,
tmux is great, and I love the command line, but the skill floor, in my particular situation,
is much lower for me in VSCode, I can a whole lot more with less effort, for now at least,
compared to the classic Unix editor. I will still use it for simple and minor editing
on the terminal, but for my daily tasks, focused mostly on JavaScript web dev
