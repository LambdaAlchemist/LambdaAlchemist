# The Alchemist's Lab
#

Base project containing all my settings for both Linux and MacOS systems.
On a freshly installed sytem, clone this repo to $HOME, and install Homebrew:

$ git clone git@github.com:elf-alchemist/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

To get started, run:

$ make

Now, Make will guide you on the rest, allowing you to install up-to-date
packages with Homebrew and other configuration setup.
